# Smartphone-Based Spectroscopy for Estimating Soil Properties

This repository contains the data and code for the paper "Smartphone-based spectroscopy as a tool to estimate soil attributes for the citizen science concept", published in Smart Agricultural Technology, Elsevier with [DOI] (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atech.2023.100327)

## Introduction

This project explores the use of smartphone-based spectroscopy as a low-cost and accessible tool for estimating soil properties. The goal of this project is to develop a system that can be used by citizen scientists to collect data on soil health.

## Data

The data used in this project consists of the following:
- Camera images: A collection of images of soil samples taken with a smartphone camera.
- ASD spectra: A collection of spectra of soil samples taken with an ASD spectrometer.
- Soil data: A collection of soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content.

## Methods

The methods used in this project consist of the following:
- Image processing: The camera images were processed to extract features that are relevant to soil properties.
- Regression methods: A variety of regression models were used to predict soil properties from the camera images and ASD spectra.

## Results

The results of this project show that smartphone-based spectroscopy can be used to accurately predict a variety of soil properties. The best performing models were able to achieve a sufficiently good degree of accuracy for most of the soil properties that were tested.
